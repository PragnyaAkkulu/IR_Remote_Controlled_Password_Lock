# IR_Remote_Controlled_Password_Lock
Circuit is as shown.

Connect the motor to your door latch.
To get the button values for your IR remote , use the IR remote test code and change the b array with corresponding values.
If you do not want to have a password lock you can use the very simple ir lock code that just opens and closes with the press of a button.
Toodles!
